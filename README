StatAnal - A Statistical analyzation library written in Haskell.

--Uses
There are uses in text processing here. If the user of this library does not know how to use Regular Expressions, this library can also be used for that. 

There is also a compression algorithm now, where "11111111110000000000" could become (110)(010). It works well on massive repeated strings.

--Plans
MANY more functions that will help scoreAccuracy' determine the correct answer.

--License
